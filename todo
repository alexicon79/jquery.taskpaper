0.2:
- refactor out all references to treeview (currently the css is still a dependency)
- remove the content-editable handlers and replace with simple form inputs (although editing won't have a wysiwyg feel the code will be simpler and stable)
- remove lines with spaces
- be able to deal with tabs in the document
- have a tree structure that allow the list to "come back in" (this is a broken hierarchical tree because it can only grow in depth)
- get the packaging working correctly (the min version is broken)
- refactor the plugin all into one namespace $.fn.taskpaper and alias it to tp - currently alot sits at the $.fn level (too much)

0.3:
- send results back to a server
